# Cracking the Coding Interview 

Rustam-ZüöÄ ‚Ä¢ 8 June 2021

I post here interesting content for preparation: [@crackingmaang](https://t.me/crackingmaang)

- [Algorithms & data structures topics](#topics)

- [Extra Resources](#extra-resources)

## General plan
1. Learn DS and Algorithms
2. Solve algorithms
3. Repeat concepts
4. Learn System Design
5. Write resume
6. Prepare for behavioral interview
7. Find people for referral and apply
8. Pass interview
9. Get offer, negotiate salary! üçæ

## How to approach solving algorithm?
**Constraints, Ideas, Complexities, Code, and Tests**

1. Read the problem. Don‚Äôt immediately jump into coding!
2. Understand inputs & outputs. Draw some examples on paper.
3. Ask questions, and find constraints. Find edge cases. Example questions: is it ASCII or Unicode? what is the Max value? is there a difference between capital letters and small letters?
4. Thinking about the solution in mind. Divide problems into sub-problems.
5. Evaluate the complexity
6. Think better alternative solution
7. Write code on paper
8. Debug your code on paper, and test with new corner case inputs
9. Write code and write tests

## Topics
- Big-O = **how quickly the runtime grows relative to the input as the input gets arbitrarily large.**
- Strings
    - ASCII, Unicode
    - How are strings implemented in your programming language (for example, is there a maximum length)?
    - Search for substrings (for example, the Rabin-Karp algorithm).
    - RegEx
- Arrays
    - Details of implementation in your programming language. For example, for C++ you need to know the implementation using pointers, and vectors. For vectors, you also need to know, for example, that it periodically does resize, and other similar details.
- Linked lists
    - Singly linked list
    - Doubly linked list
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees
    - DFS, BFS
    - Adding and removing elements
    - Less common tree types (e.g., red black trees, B-trees) - what are they, how they
    differ from the binary trees, basic complexities, and how they are used. No need to know all the rotations in the RB-tree, for example.
    - Tries
- Heaps
    - Heap sort
    - Using heaps for tracking top-K
    - Allocating elements on a heap vs on a stack - what does it mean?
- Graphs
    - DFS, BFS
    - Topological search
    - Shortest path
- Hash
    - Hash functions
    - Universal hash
- Algorithms
    - Sorting
        - Especially make sure you know heap sort, merge sort and quick sort.
    - Searching
        - Binary search
        - Searching in linked lists, arrays, trees, graphs, dictionaries...
    - Dynamic programming = problems, which are problems where the solution is composed of solutions to the same problem with smaller inputs.
        - Recursion
        - Bottom-up
        - Top-down
        - Backtracking = Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time.
    - Greedy algorithms
    - Recursion
